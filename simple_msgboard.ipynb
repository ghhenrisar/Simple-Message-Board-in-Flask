    "For beginner of Python, I would suggest PyCharm as your development environment. You can get started [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/quick-start-guide.html).\n",
    "> PyCharm is a dedicated Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) providing a wide range of essential tools for Python developers, tightly integrated to create a convenient environment for productive Python, web, and data science development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual environment is useful when you are learning or writing codes becuase each virtual environment is stand-alone such that other environment is not affected. [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.html) can also support this.\n",
    "> PyCharm makes it possible to use the virtualenv tool to create a project-specific isolated virtual environment. The main purpose of virtual environments is to manage settings and dependencies of a particular project regardless of other Python projects. virtualenv tool comes bundled with PyCharm, so the user doesn't need to install it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we are going to use [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/).\n",
    "> Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around Werkzeug and Jinja and has become one of the most popular Python web application frameworks.\n",
