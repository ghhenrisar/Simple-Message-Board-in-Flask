    "> PyCharm is a dedicated Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) providing a wide range of essential tools for Python developers, tightly integrated to create a convenient environment for productive Python, web, and data science development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual environment is useful when you are learning or writing codes becuase each virtual environment is stand-alone such that other environment is not affected. [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.html) can also support this.\n",
    "> PyCharm makes it possible to use the virtualenv tool to create a project-specific isolated virtual environment. The main purpose of virtual environments is to manage settings and dependencies of a particular project regardless of other Python projects. virtualenv tool comes bundled with PyCharm, so the user doesn't need to install it.\n",
